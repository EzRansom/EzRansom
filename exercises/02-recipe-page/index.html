            Double Strawberry Chocolate Matcha Cookies
        </h1>

        <p>
            This recipe is inspired by Jacques’ famous chocolate chip cookies 
            dipped in chocolate, but with a fresh twist—the chocolate is a 
            creamy strawberry white chocolate, and the cookie dough is infused 
            with vibrant, earthy matcha. Each bite delivers a perfect balance of 
            chewy texture, subtle bitterness from the matcha, and sweet, fruity 
            bursts from the strawberry chocolate chunks. Finished with a smooth 
            dip of strawberry white chocolate on the bottom, these cookies are 
            as beautiful as they are delicious.

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <h3>STRAWBERRY CHOCOLATE:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Blend the freeze-dried strawberries into a fine powder using a 
                food processor or high-speed blender.
                </li> <br>
            
                <li>
                    Stir the strawberry powder into the melted white chocolate 
                    until fully smooth and evenly combined.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Pour half of the strawberry chocolate onto a parchment-lined 
                    tray, spread into a thin layer, and refrigerate or freeze 
                    until firm.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Set the remaining half of the strawberry chocolate aside in 
                    a bowl for dipping later.<br>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Once the chilled chocolate has set, chop it into small 
                    chunks and keep them ready to fold into the cookie dough.
                </li>
                <br>
        </ol>
        <h3>COOKIE DOUGH & BAKING</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>
                In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, 
                cornstarch, and matcha powder.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, beat the room temperature butter, 
                white sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy, 
                about 1 to 2 minutes.    
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract, and beat again until
                smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until a soft dough 
                forms.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Fold in the chopped strawberry chocolate chunks 
                (about 1 to 1 1/2 cups) until evenly combined.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Let the dough rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with 
                parchment paper.          
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Scoop dough using a large ice cream scoop and place 6 on each 
                tray, spaced apart.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake for 11 minutes, until the edges are lightly golden and the 
                centers are still a bit gooey and soft.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the pan for 10 
                minutes to finish setting.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and let them cool 
                completely. Bake the second batch of cookies in the meantime.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                If the reserved strawberry chocolate has firmed up, gently 
                re-melt it by microwaving the bowl in 10 to 15 second intervals,
                stirring well between each, until smooth and melted. Then dip 
                the bottom of each cooled cookie into the strawberry chocolate.
            </li>
            <br>           
            <li>
                Place them back on a parchment-lined tray and pop them in the 
                fridge for 10 minutes or until the chocolate is fully set.
            </li>
